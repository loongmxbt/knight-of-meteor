Ben Newman
@benjamn
A common thread that runs through Ben’s history of employment at Meebo, Apture, Mozilla, Quora, Facebook, and Meteor is a passion for exploring the limits of dynamic programming languages. Many of his most recent projects have involved large-scale automatic code transformation that would be difficult or impossible without the tools he has developed, namely recast and ast-types. He implemented Quora’s rich-text answer editor and Facebook’s Regenerator project, remains an active React contributor, and represents Meteor in the TC39 JavaScript standards process. The future of JavaScript can’t get here soon enough, as far as Ben is concerned.


Robert Dickert
@rdickert
Robert is a cofounder of the Velocity project, now the standard application testing framework for Meteor. Long before that, he got his engineering start writing 6502 assembler, went on to build networking products at a startup telecom carrier, and later traded stock and currency derivatives. A resident of Boulder, Colorado, he is the past president and current member of the board for a Boulder arts non-profit and a choral soloist and occasional lead in community theater productions. As an undergraduate at Stanford, he ran an experimental study that demonstrated the harmful effects of social comparison.
