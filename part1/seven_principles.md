Principles of Meteor

Data on the Wire. Meteor doesn't send HTML over the network. The server sends data and lets the client render it.

One Language. Meteor lets you write both the client and the server parts of your application in JavaScript.

Database Everywhere. You can use the same methods to access your database from the client or the server.

Latency Compensation. On the client, Meteor prefetches data and simulates models to make it look like server method calls return instantly.

Full Stack Reactivity. In Meteor, realtime is the default. All layers, from database to template, update themselves automatically when necessary.

Embrace the Ecosystem. Meteor is open source and integrates with existing open source tools and frameworks.

Simplicity Equals Productivity. The best way to make something seem simple is to have it actually be simple. Meteor's main functionality has clean, classically beautiful APIs.
