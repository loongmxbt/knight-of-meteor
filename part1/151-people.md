@n1mmy
Nick has built everything from peer-to-peer networks, to iPhone applications, to the software inside black vans. Most recently, he built the Hadoop infrastructure at Mochi Media. He founded MixApp with Geoff, where he invented a technique for opening bidirectional connections through NATs by embedding a TCP stack in user-space. As an undergraduate at MIT, he wrote cryptography software that let groups of people have secure, anonymous conversations over mailing lists.

@yaliceme
Alice has been adding friendliness to technical endeavors for almost 10 years. In 2004, she founded RubietySociety, a Rubik's learning club that attracts many learners who had never seen themselves as Rubik's-solvers. Before Meteor, she worked on startup products including a rentable napping pod and digital music stand. In college, she started and led the Solar Fire Project, an effort to replace harmful wood-fire cooking in Nicaragua with a solar-fired cooking stove that can be built by hand. She designed a prototype that simplified reflector construction by using simple 2D parabolic trough sections working in series, instead of the more common piecewise approximation of a 3D paraboloidal dish. Alice holds a BS and MEng from Cornell, where she choreographed and taught for the Chinese cultural dance troupe.

Justin founded FathomDB, a YCombinator-backed company that pioneered database-as-a-service in 2008, and was the first to offer XaaS around openly-available software. He built the systems that ran FathomDB's MySQL-as-a-service on both Rackspace and Amazon clouds. While at FathomDB, he was one of the early core team members that created OpenStack, helping to create a fully open-source cloud. Justin read Mathematics at (the original) Cambridge.


Matthew Brewer
Before joining Meteor, Brewer was the technical lead for Crawl SRE at Google. He was responsible for the stability of Google's crawl system from the operating system kernel up, and for ongoing system design and operations. He also worked on Google's performance and correctness stats collection, redesigning its configuration distribution system and backing database. Prior to Google, Brewer researched robotics and AI for 8 years and helped teach kernel development and threading at Carnegie Mellon. When not programming, Brewer is often found hiking long trails like the Appalachian Trail and the JMT.

Sam received her BA in Marketing at UNLV, where she helped lead the Women's Volleyball team to a Mountain West Conference Championship.


Ben Newman
@benjamn
A common thread that runs through Ben’s history of employment at Meebo, Apture, Mozilla, Quora, Facebook, and Meteor is a passion for exploring the limits of dynamic programming languages. Many of his most recent projects have involved large-scale automatic code transformation that would be difficult or impossible without the tools he has developed, namely recast and ast-types. He implemented Quora’s rich-text answer editor and Facebook’s Regenerator project, remains an active React contributor, and represents Meteor in the TC39 JavaScript standards process. The future of JavaScript can’t get here soon enough, as far as Ben is concerned.


Robert Dickert
@rdickert
Robert is a cofounder of the Velocity project, now the standard application testing framework for Meteor. Long before that, he got his engineering start writing 6502 assembler, went on to build networking products at a startup telecom carrier, and later traded stock and currency derivatives. A resident of Boulder, Colorado, he is the past president and current member of the board for a Boulder arts non-profit and a choral soloist and occasional lead in community theater productions. As an undergraduate at Stanford, he ran an experimental study that demonstrated the harmful effects of social comparison. An avid mountain biker and mogul skiier, he has lived abroad in France and Japan.
