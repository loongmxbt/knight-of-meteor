# A JavaScript Primer For Meteor

JavaScript is a language full of contradictions: it’s named after Java even though it doesn’t have anything to do with it, it was [created in 10 days](#javascript-short-histtory) but is still in use 20 years later, and despite getting its fair share of criticism, it’s ubiquitous on the web.

If JavaScript has one thing going for it, is that it’s easy to get started with. Now don’t get me wrong: truly mastering JavaScript is a difficult task. But learning enough to get by isn’t that hard, and shouldn’t take long especially if you already have some experience with other programming languages.

What’s more, when building Meteor apps you’ll often find yourself re-using the same patterns over and over. And as stated by the Pareto principle, learning 20% of a language should be enough to cover 80% of situations.

So today, let’s take a look at the absolute minimum amount of JavaScript you need to know to learn Meteor.
