# A JavaScript Primer For Meteor

JavaScript is a language full of contradictions: it’s named after Java even though it doesn’t have anything to do with it, it was [created in 10 days][#javascript-histtory] but is still in use 20 years later, and despite getting its fair share of criticism, it’s ubiquitous on the web.
Javacript毫无疑问是一门充满矛盾与争议的语言：它打着Java的名号招摇过市却与Java毫无关联，它的诞生仅用了短短[10天][#javascript-histtory]却仍在20年后的今日广泛应用，尽管它被开发人员们广为诟病，但是在当今Web开发中却有着无可替代的地位，有哪个Web应用敢说它没有一行Javascript代码？

If JavaScript has one thing going for it, is that it’s easy to get started with. Now don’t get me wrong: truly mastering JavaScript is a difficult task. But learning enough to get by isn’t that hard, and shouldn’t take long especially if you already have some experience with other programming languages.
如果要为Javascript找个优点的话，那无疑是它很容易上手。但千万别高兴的太早，完全掌握Javascript也是一项非常艰巨的任务。学习到够用的程度并不是那么难，而且假设你之前有一些编程经验，那么你学起来会更快。

What’s more, when building Meteor apps you’ll often find yourself re-using the same patterns over and over. And as stated by the Pareto principle, learning 20% of a language should be enough to cover 80% of situations.
更重要的是，在Meteor中，你会发现自己一直在使用重复的代码模式。就如二八原理所阐述的那样，学习这门语言的20%足以应对80%的应用场景。

So today, let’s take a look at the absolute minimum amount of JavaScript you need to know to learn Meteor.
所以，这里我们会学习最少的JavaScript知识来帮助你掌握Meteor。

### Following Along

Did you know that you already possessed a full-fledged JavaScript development environment? I’m talking about the very browser you’re reading this with! (Unless you’re using Lynx I guess. Sucks to be you.)

So you can follow along with all these examples simply by typing them into your browser console. Here’s a handy guide on how to open it in various browsers.

Ready? Let’s learn some JavaScript!

### Variables

Here’s how you declare a variable in JavaScript:

你可以这样在JavaScript中声明一个变量：

```js
var a;
```
The var keyword lets JavaScript know that whatever comes after is a variable. Now let’s assign a value to our variable:

var关键字使JavaScript知道后面的是变量，接着我们来给变量赋值：

```js
var a = 12;
```
Now maybe you’ve seen something like this while looking at some JavaScript code:
你可能会看到如下形式的代码：

```js
a = 12;
```
JavaScript doesn’t seem to mind when you ommit the var keyword. So what is it good for?
JavaScript并不关心你是否省略var关键字。所以使用var关键字的好处在哪儿呢？

The var keyword makes our variable local. Inside a Meteor app, this means that prefixing a variable with var will restrict its scope to the function you’re declaring it in (or the file, if you declare it outside of any function).
var关键字使变量成为局部变量。在Meteor中，使用var关键字能让变量作用域限制在函数中。

此外，省略var关键字能让变量在整个Meteor应用中都可见。一些时候这是有用的，但大多数时候还是不要污染全局为妙。

On the other hand, omitting the var keyword will make your variable available to your whole Meteor app. Sometimes that’s good, but in most case it’s better to try and avoid polluting the global scope.

### Functions

Here’s how you declare a function in JavaScript:
以下是JavaScript中函数声明：

```js
var myAwesomeFunction = function (myArgument) {
  // do something
}
```
And here’s how you’d call your function:
和函数调用：
```js
myAwesomeFunction(something);
```
You’ll notice function declarations follow the same var something = somethingElse pattern as variable declarations.
你会发现函数声明和变量声明一样，需要使用var。

As they should, since in JavaScript, functions are variables too! This means that you can do stuff like using functions as arguments for other functions:
在JavaScript中，函数也是变量！那意味着你可以把函数作为变量传入函数的参数列表中
```js
square = function (a) {
  return a*a;
}
applyOperation = function (f, a) {
  return f(a);
}
applyOperation (square, 10); // 100
```
### Return

A return statement takes a value and returns this value as the result of a function. The key thing to remember here is that whatever comes after return will never get executed:
return语句接收一个值并把这个值作为函数返回值。需要记住的事，return后面的语句不会被执行。
```js
myFunction = function (a) {
  return a * 3;
  explodeComputer(); // will never get executed (hopefully!)
}
```
### If Statements
Here’s what an If statement looks like in JavaScript:
```js
if (foo) {
  return bar;
}
```
As long as the block of code inside the if fits in one line, you can also use this shorthand syntax (note the lack of curly brackets):
只要if语句块只有一行，那么你可以省略大括号。
```js
if (foo)
  return bar;
```

### If/Else Statements
Here’s what an If/Else statement looks like in JavaScript:
```js
if (foo) {
  function1();
} else {
  function2();
}
```
If/Else statements also have their own shorthand syntax:
If/Else 语句有缩写

```js
foo ? function1() : function2();
```
This is particularly useful when assigning a value to a variable:
这在赋值语句中很有用：

```js
var n = foo ? 1 : 2;
```
This means “if foo is true, then set n to 1, otherwise set it to 2”.

Oh and for good measure, here’s an If/Else If/Else:
```js
if (foo) {
  function1();
} else if (bar) {
  function2();
} else {
  function3();
}
```
### JavaScript Arrays
Here’s how you define an array:
```js
a = [123, 456, 789];
```
And here’s how you access an array item (indexes start at 0):
```js
a[1]; // 456
```

### JavaScript Objects

Here’s how you define a JavaScript object:
```js
myProfile = {
  name: "John Smith",
  email: "johnsmith@gmail.com",
  'zip code': 12345,
  isInvited: true
}
```
After the object declaration (myProfile = {…}) comes a list of comma-separated pairs. Each pair contains a key (a string, which can optionally be enclosed in quotes if it contains any spaces) and a value (any type of JavaScript item: strings, numbers, booleans, variables, arrays, objects, and even functions).
在对象声明中，有一系列逗号分隔的键值对。

You can also nest objects, and even use arrays:
你可以嵌套对象，也可以使用数组：
```js
myProfile = {
  name: "John Smith",
  email: "johnsmith@gmail.com",
  city: "San Francisco",
  points: 1234,
  isInvited: true,
  friends: [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "johndoe@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      name: "Jane Doe",
      email: "janedoe@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}
```
Accessing an object’s property couldn’t be simpler: just use the dot notation. You can even combine it with arrays:
获取对象属性相当简单，只需要使用点标记即可，你可以把它和数组一起用。
```js
myProfile.name; // John Smith
myProfile.friends[1].name; // Jane Doe
```
You’ll find JavaScript objects almost everywhere in JavaScript, especially when invoking functions. For example, here’s how you would search for a post in your database with Meteor:
你会发现JavaScript对象无处不在，尤其是在调用函数时。如，这里是你在Meteor搜索一篇文章
```js
Posts.findOne({ title: 'My First Post' });
```
This {title: 'My First Post'} argument is an anonymous JavaScript object. With JavaScript, you’ll see that most of the time you don’t actually need to assign a name to an object (or even to a function) to make use of it.
{title: 'My First Post'} 参数是一个匿名JavaScript对象，在JavaScript中，你会发现大多数情况你无需给对象命名。


### Anonymous Functions 匿名函数
We’ve seen you can declare functions using the following syntax:
你可以使用如下语法声明函数：
```js
myFunction = function (myArgument) {
  // do something
}
```
我们知道JavaScript把函数看做变量，你可以把函数当做参数传递给其他函数：
And we’ve seen that JavaScript treats functions just like variables, letting you pass them as arguments to other functions:
```js
square = function (a) {
  return a*a;
}
applyOperation = function (f, a) {
  return f(a);
}
applyOperation(square, 10); // 100
```
JavaScript喜欢简洁的方式写代码，下面的语法是相同的：
And we’ve also seen that JavaScript loves coming up with shorter ways to write things. So here’s an equivalent syntax:
```js
applyOperation = function (f, a) {
  return f(a);
}
applyOperation(
  function(a){
    return a*a;
  }, 
  10
) // 100
```

Instead of defining the square function and passing it as an argument, we’re defining it inside the argument call. This is known as using an “anonymous function”, and it’s one of the most common JavaScript patterns around.

### Chaining
We’ve seen that you can pass parameters to functions. But there’s another syntax that you’ll often encounter for things such as array or string operations:
```js
var myArray = [123, 456];
myArray.push(789) // 123, 456, 789
var myString = "abcdef";
myString.replace("a", "z"); // "zbcdef"
```
This dot notation means “call the replace function on myString with arguments “a” and “z” and return the result”.

The beauty of it is that you can also chain multiple links together as long as they all return something. We won’t get into how to define chainable functions, but using them is easy enough. Just follow the something.function1().function2().function3() pattern.

Each link of the chain will take a value, apply a function to it, and then pass on its result to the next link:
```js
n = 5;
n.double().square(); //100
```

### This

this is probably one of the hardest concept to master in all of JavaScript.
this是JavaScript概念中最难理解的部分。

Basically, the this keyword lets you access the object on which you’re currently working: just like a chameleon, this keeps changing based on its surroundings.
总体来说，this关键词使你能够进入你当前使用的对象，它就像变色龙，会根据周围环境不断变化。

So instead of trying to explain this, let me give you two tools to help you figure things out yourself (what do you mean, I’m taking the easy way out?!).
所以与其尝试解释它，不如给你两个工具让你自己发现了解它：

The first is the good old console.log(), which prints any object to the browser’s console. Adding a console.log(this) to begin a function is often the best way to figure out what’s going on:
第一个是经典的console.log()，它会输出任何对象到浏览器的console。console.log(this)
```js
myFunction = function (a, b) {
  console.log(this);
  // do something
}
```
The second pattern is assigning this to another variable:
```js
myFunction = function (a, b) {
  var myObject = this;
  // do something
}
```
While it might at first seem like this doesn’t accomplish anything, it lets you safely re-use myObject throughout your code, since unlike this its value won’t change depending on the context.
这可能初看没什么用，但是它可以让你重复使用myObject在代码中，与this不同，它并不会随上下文改变而改变。

### Operators

= is the assigment operator. This means that a = 12 means assign the value “12” to a.

If you want to compare two values, you would use ==, as in a == 12.

JavaScript also features the === operator, which compares both value and type (i.e. string, integer, etc.):
```js
a = "12";
a == 12; // true
a === 12; // false
```
In most cases, you’ll want to use the === operator whenever comparing two values, because there aren’t that many cases where you’d want two variables to be equal in value but not in type.

Here’s JavaScript’s unequality operator:
```js
a = 12;
a !== 11; // true
```
The ! operator can also be used independently to get the opposite of a boolean value:
```js
a = true;
!a; // false
```
An interesting consequence of the ! operator is that it always returns a boolean value, even if what comes after is not a boolean:
```js
a = 12;
!a; // false
```
This means that if you want to convert a variable to boolean you can just use the ! operator twice (once to force the variable to boolean, a second time to revert the value back):
```js
a = 12;
!!a; // true
```
Or:
```js
a = 0;
!!a; // false
```
Weird Random Characters

You’ll often encounter stuff like this:
```js
$('body').addClass('loaded');
```
Or this:
```js
_.shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```
You might think $ and _ are special JavaScript operators, but they’re actually just user-defined variable names!

$() is commonly used as an alias for the jQuery function (from the jQuery library), while _ is the main object of the Underscore library.

So if you ever encounter some weird out-of-place character in your JavaScript code, make sure it’s not a variable before assuming you just discovered a new, little-used syntax feature.

### Style

Finally, here are a few optional style rules that will make your JavaScript code cleaner:

Use camelCase: write myRandomVariable, not my_random_variable.
Add a ; at the end of each line, even if it’s optional.
Separate each keyword with a space, i.e. a = b + 1, not a=b+1.
You’ll find more guidelines in the Meteor Style Guide.

### Putting It Together

So now that you’re equipped with the basics of JavaScript syntax, let’s try to put it together and understand a bit of Meteor code (adapted from Microscope, the app we’ll build step by step in Discover Meteor):
```js
Template.postEdit.events({
  'submit form': function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    var currentPostId = this._id;

    var postProperties = {
      url: $(event.target).find('[name=url]').val(),
      title: $(event.target).find('[name=title]').val()
    }

    Posts.update(currentPostId, {$set: postProperties}, function(error) {
      if (error) {
        // display the error to the user
        throwError(error.reason);
      } else {
        Router.go('postPage', {_id: currentPostId});
      }
    });
  }
});
```
This tells the app what to do when someone submits the form that lets you edit a post:

First, prevent the default browser behavior for the submit event.
Then, define a variable containing the current post’s ID.
Get the latest value of the text fields.
Update the database with those values.
Finally, either throw an error, or redirect the user.
Let’s break this down (I’ll highlight each syntax pattern as we go):

Template.postEdit.events({: We’re diving into the Template object, accessing its postEdit property, then using dot notation to call the events() function (which is itself a property of postEdit) on an anonymous JavaScript object ({}) (chaining, JavaScript objects).

'submit form': function(e) {: The first (and only) key/value pair of the JavaScript object. Since the key (submit form) contains a space, it’s enclosed in quotes. The value is an anonymous function called with one argument (event).

event.preventDefault();: We’re calling the preventDefault(); function of the event object that was just passed as an argument to stop the form’s default submit behavior.

var currentPostId = this._id;: In this context, this corresponds to the post being edited. We’re declaring a local variable (currentPostId) whose value is that post’s _id property.

var postProperties = {: We’re declaring another JavaScript object and using jQuery (the $ sign is an alias for the Jquery object) to get the url and title field’s value from the user interface.

Posts.update(currentPostId, {$set: postProperties}, function(error) {: We’re passing three things to the update() function: the ID of the post to update, a JavaScript object containing the properties to update, and finally a callback anonymous function that will run once the update has concluded.

### Going Forward

This tutorial is by no means meant to replace actually learning JavaScript. But the various patterns covered here should be enough to let you understand the vast majority of Discover Meteor’s code, at least from a syntax point of view.

So if like me you prefer learning by doing, hopefully this should be enough to get you ready to start building Meteor apps!
